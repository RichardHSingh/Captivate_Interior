# Captivate_Interior

In order to attain a passing grade in Web Development papers at Techtorium, I had to create a website to inform users about an organisation known as Captivate Interior. This project also had students using CSS framework Bootstrap. This project is 3 of 3 projects one had to produce and fill in all requirements.
